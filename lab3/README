1. Both insertion sort and merge sort worked well.
===================================================

2. Analysis for behaviour of Insertion sort and Merge Sort
==========================================================
**INSERTION SORT**
	Worst-Case: 	
		Comparisons 	= (n-1).n/2 (Order of n^2)
		Swaps 		= (n-1).n/2 (Order of n^2)
		Copy Operations	= 0 (Order of 1)

	Average-Case: In this case the running time would be half of the worst-case running time.But in asymptotic notation, where constant coefficients don't matter, the running time in the average case would still be in order of n^2, just like the worst case.
 	
		Comparisons 	= (Order of n^2)
		Swaps 		= (Order of n^2) 	
		Copy Operations	= 0 (Order of 1)

	Best-Case: 	
		Comparisons 	= (n-1) (Order of n)
		Swaps 		= 0 (Order of 1)
		Copy Operations	= 0 (Order of 1)

**MERGE SORT**
	Worst-Case: 	
		Comparisons 	= (Order of n.log[n])
		Swaps 		= 0 (Order of 1) 	
		Copy Operations	= (Order of n.log[n])

	Average-Case: 	
		Comparisons 	= (Order of n.log[n])
		Swaps 		= 0 (Order of 1)	
		Copy Operations	= (Order of n.log[n])

	Best-Case: 	
		Comparisons 	= (Order of n.log[n])
		Swaps 		= 0 (Order of 1) 	
		Copy Operations	= (Order of n.log[n])
